            <h2 id='info-title'>Here's a timeline of Zuckerberg's career:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2003</strong> - Launches Facemash - a web programme enabling Harvard students to compare images of same-gender students and rate the more attractive - and nearly gets kicked out when its immediate popularity draws the attention of the university administrators.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2004</strong> - Starts Thefacebook.com in February. Drops out of Harvard at the end of his sophomore year; moves to Palo Alto that summer, where he rents a house with a now-famous swimming pool (and zip-wire).                    
                    Later this year, Facebook hits 200,000 users; contacts venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, and receives an initial investment of half a million dollars - some of which is used to splash out on a small office above a Chinese restaurant.                    
                    The Winklevoss twins file a lawsuit against Zuckerberg claiming he ripped off their idea for a new social network, HarvardConnection (later ConnectU).
                </li>
                <li><strong>2005</strong> - Facebook hits 5 million users.</li>
                <li><strong>2006</strong> - At 22 years of age, Zuckerberg turns down an estimated $1 billion dollar offer for Facebook from Yahoo.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2007</strong> - Opens Facebook beyond universities so anyone with an email address can join; turns down a $15 billion offer from Microsoft, which would have bagged him personally $4 billion.                   
                    Allows independent developers to write programmes for Facebook; but is forced to apologise when Beacon, a controversial new addition to Facebook allowing users to view what their friends have been buying online, raises major complaints over privacy intrusion.
                </li>
                <li><strong>2008</strong> - Reaches a settlement with Winklevoss lawsuit worth $65 million, though still denies any intellectual property theft</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2010</strong> - Named Time magazineâ€™s person of the year.                    
                    Hollywood movie The Social Network is released documenting Zuckerberg's time at Harvard and the early days of Facebook.
                </li>
                <li><strong>2016</strong> - Zuckerberg was ranked 10th on Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People</li>
            </ul>
